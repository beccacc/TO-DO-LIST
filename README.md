# TO-DO LIST

## Code your week

***My project*** allows you to...
- *Add*, *remove*, and *complete* tasks
- *Schedule* your tasks for **days** and **times**
- View your planner as a whole, as well as specific days
- *Load/save* a to-do list to/from a file
- Check the *status* of different tasks

  
## UML Class Diagram
- A UML Class Diagram of this project can be found beneath README.md as UMLClassDiagram.png
- If I had more time to improve my code after looking at my UML class diagram I think I would've created a bi-directional association between my different button classes, and my GUI class
