# My Planner Project

## Code your week

What will ***my project*** do?
- Allow you to *add*, *remove*, and *complete* tasks
- Allow you to *schedule* your tasks for **days** and **times**
- Allow you to view your planner as a whole and check the status of different tasks

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create a new task and add it to my planner
- As a user, I want to be able to select a task and assign it to a day
- As a user, I want to be able to select a day and see how many tasks I have for that day
- As a user, I want to be able to select a task and see if it has been completed
- As a user, I want to be able to save my to-do list to file
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my to-do list from file

## Phase 4: Task 2
- Make appropriate use of the Map interface somewhere in your code
- In the Planner class, one of the field in Planner is a Map: the key is a day, and the value is a task.
- Make appropriate use of a bi-directional association somewhere in your code.
- My code has a bi-directional association between the Planner class and JsonWriter class, and the Planner class and
  the JsonReader
- The association allows the code in the Planner class to access the code in the JsonReader and JsonWriter classes
  and vice versa 
  
## Phase 4: Task 3
- My UML Class Diagram can be found beneath README.md as UMLClassDiagram.png
- I drew that bad boy by hand on a Friday night while I'm stuck in quarantine
- If I had more time to improve my code after looking at my UML class diagram I think I would've created a
    bi-directional association between my different button classes, and my GUI class
